**Oncogene Expression Analysis by Chromosome**
This code snippet provides a tool to analyze and visualize the expression levels of oncogenes across different chromosomes in various cancer types.

**Functionality**
Oncogene Expression: The code extracts and analyzes the expression levels of user-specified oncogenes.
Chromosome Selection: Users can choose a specific chromosome to focus on.
Cancer Type Flexibility: The script allows users to analyze different cancer types by modifying the query variable.
Visualization: The results are presented visually, likely using a plot to depict gene expression patterns.

**Usage**
**Here's how to use this snippet:**

Define the Oncogene of Interest: Replace <ONCOGENE_NAME> with the specific oncogene you want to analyze.
Set Chromosome Number: Change <CHROMOSOME_NUMBER> to the desired chromosome (e.g., 1, 2, etc.).
Adjust Cancer Type (Optional): Modify the query variable to analyze a different cancer type. The current query might be specific to a particular cancer type (check the code for details).
Note: Depending on the specific implementation, you might need additional libraries or data files to run this code.
